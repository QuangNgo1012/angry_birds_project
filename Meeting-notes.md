## Challenges

1. The team still has difficulty in agreeing on the content of plan.
2. Some parts of the plan are still unsastified and need changes.

## Actions

As nobody has experience on such project before, 
we decide to have the first week to learn the basic idea of the project and figure out 
which parts we want to specialize in next week meetings.
In this way, we do not have to study all the aspect of the project but focus on a single aspect. 


> Please reflect these action decisions in your git commit messages so that 
> your group members and advisor can follow the progress.

## Project status 
The project Plan is finished, and the team is slearning and preparing for the project.

### TODOs

2. Getting used the basic aspect of the project.
